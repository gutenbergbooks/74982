</div>


<p>Mr. Walters has invited me to write a few prefatory lines to
his volume of “Civil Service Jingles and Other Things”, and I
cheerfully comply, although it may be at the risk of doing harm
to his really meritorious enterprise. It has been my privilege to
read many of these selections in manuscript, and some of them
have already seen the light of day in print. I have frankly encouraged
him to make up the present collection and give his fellow
civil servants an opportunity to have it in library form. He may
have been influenced in a positive way by this advice, and to that
extent I find an excuse for adding my commendation now. I
really like these aptly named “Jingles”, which have clearly been
written more for the idle hour than the study. They appeal to
me as revealing a bright and observing mind, combined with the
rare gift of putting ideas into an entertainingly satirical shape.
They are witty without being unwholesome, and while they are
not in any sense pretentious, they are nevertheless distinctly
creditable to Mr. Walters’ genius.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">AND HOW HE SAVED HIS BACON</p>


<p>And Gastonio was sore afraid; he quaked with fear so that his
knees wobbled, and his face paled even to the brown wart on his
nose.</p>

<p>And the reason thereof was that his brother Alphonso was
discovered.</p>

<p>And he lifted up his voice, and it was a heavy voice, and he
roared like unto the roar of a bull, and he cried out, “If my
brother Alphonso is discovered, I am found.”</p>

<p>Now Alphonso, the brother of Gastonio, was a lobster, strong
in the claw but weak in the headpiece, and he was expensive
and needed much money.</p>

<p>And Alphonso had a large open face with nothing behind it;
but Gastonio had a small narrow face and behind it was much.</p>

<p>And these two were in the service of the King—Gastonio
the elder, because he knew things, and Alphonso because his
brother Gastonio was in it.</p>

<p>And it came to pass that Alphonso used much public money,
but gave little service therefor. And the multitude became wise
and discovered Alphonso in his ill-doing. And Gastonio was sore
afraid lest he, too, should be separated from his breath. And so
he wept and lamented that he had closed his eye to the doings
of Alphonso.</p>

<p>And there was a great meeting of the rulers of the people,
in the House which is called Common, because it is so. And they
made inquiries into things. And one of the things was Alphonso.</p>

<p>And so the Rulers called Gastonio before them and demanded
of him saying: “Where is thy brother? What doeth he? And
wherefore doth he live on the fat of the land, yet toil not, neither
spin, except such yarns as are called “smutty”?”</p>

<p>And Gastonio communed within himself, with fear and
trembling.</p>

<p>“Speak,” said the rulers, “or be condemned.”</p>

<p>And, behold, a cunning scheme came into the mind of Gastonio,
and he spoke thusly: “Know ye my masters, that the
doings of my brother Alphonso are not to my cognizance. Some
one thinking to curry favour in my sight hath appointed him
and put this money in his hand without my knowledge or
consent.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the Rulers, “we must have an investigation.”</p>

<p>And immediately Gastonio was aware that he was saved, and
he smiled a long smile in his sleeve, for he knew that He who is
Investigated is Safe.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_RISE_AND_FALL_OF_TRIPE">THE RISE AND FALL OF TRIPE</h2>
</div>


<p>In the reign of the Caliph John Aye the great Mac, there
dwelt in the Mountain City, a poor scribe called <i>Patrie-pa</i>, a son of
the East who made a precarious living pen pushing; and the
neighbors of Patrie-pa and the neighbors’ little boys referred to
him as “Tripe” for short. One day Tripe, while carrying a large
roll of Manuscript to a customer, stopped to rest himself upon
the steps of a great palace; the air that came from within the
palace was scented and sweet, and besides strains of beautiful
music were wafted on the summer breeze accompanied by the
dulcet notes of nightingales and things.</p>

<p>From the melody, and smell of savoury dishes, Tripe concluded
that a feast with great rejoicing was in progress; being of
an enquiring turn of mind he was curious to know who so rejoiced
and the reason thereof, so he hied him to the back door of the
palace and enquired of the servants the names of the revellers.
“What?” replied one of them, “do you live in the Mountain City
and know not that this is the feast of the Conservers, the bodyguard
and henchmen of the Great Mac?” “Holy Smoke,” said
Tripe loud enough to be heard, “consider the diff. between these
and me; I am exposed every day to duns and Bailiffs and such,
and can scarcely get pea-soup for myself and family, while these
popular politicians expend the riches of the people and lead a life
of pleasure. What have they done to enjoy a lot so agreeable,
and what have I done to deserve one so wretched?” While poor
Tripe was thus complaining a servant came out of the palace and
bade him follow him, as the Caliph Mac had heard his wail and
would speak with him. Trembling, Tripe followed the servant
into the presence of the Great Mac, who by giving the poor fellow
the glad hand, soon put him at his ease. Mac enquired kindly
after his health, and on examining his Manuscript was much
pleased with the turn of his P’s and Q’s; Mac being ambitious at
the time to stand well with those of the East thought that if he
raised this poor Tripe it would be noised about and he would find
favour in the eyes of the East; so he said to Tripe, “So, so my
good scribe, you complain of your lot and wail aloud when times
are good! How now would you like a position under us? I will
make you one of my Chief Squirts, at Umpty pieces of Silver now
and again and pickings: what say you?” Now Tripe although
poor was no slouch; he had much cunning and was no moss back;
and so albeit the position of Squirt was no great dignity, he
abased himself before Mac and accepted his offer with much flow
of thankful words.</p>

<p>Before many moons had passed Tripe had shown such aptitude
as a Schemer and became so useful to Mac that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
promoted from Chief Squirt to High Jobber, and from that rose
finally to be Mac’s Wind Raiser, and so remained until the death
of Mac. Now when Mac died, the Conservers who were in power
hoped to elect another Caliph in his stead of their own stripe;
and in this they did temporarily succeed by electing one Tomtom;
but they trotted in hard luck, for Tomtom was soon gathered to
his fathers, and when they replaced Tomtom by the Caliph
Scrupper they were defeated on the first onslaught of the Liberators,
who deposed Scrupper and elected Wilfridus, the Silver
Tongue, in his stead. In this way was Tripe thrown on his beam
ends, but nothing daunted he straightway went to Wilfridus, and
by arguments of how he had enabled the Grand Old Man to raise
the wind, and by informations of all the secret hiding-places of
the Conservers, and saying also that anyway at heart he had never
been a Conserver, but really a good hot Liberator, he so worked
upon the credulity of Wilfridus, who was new to the game, that
Wilfridus reinstated him in the position of Wind-Raiser and also
made him Sinister of Wublic Perks, requiring only in return that
he should make a public exhibition of himself by changing his
Blue Coat of the Conservers for the Red Coat of the Liberators.
Thus did the cunning Tripe remain in power when his friends
fell. Immediately, Tripe, to show his ardour for his new party,
put forth all the power of his ability and raised so much and such
beautiful and Balmy Winds for the Liberators that they marvelled
at his power, and to aid him in his art they presented him for his
uses a cunningly contrived Organ with many keys and stops, and
capable of playing tunes and airs to please everyone, and they
called this wonderful organ “The Paps.” And now Tripe began
to think he was the whole thing, and that without him and his
organ the Liberators and even Wilfridus himself were Small
Potatoes; and he ground his organ to suit himself and played
wicked and mischievous airs thereon which not only stirred up the
Conservers, but annoyed many High Liberators. He also put on
his “Chapeau Parlant” and visited strange countries, and the
country of his forefathers and he talked through his Chapeau
much rot and vanity, and he ran off his trolley and went away up
in the air and thought he was a balloon and that the whole world
was watching his flight; but some good staunch Liberators who
were disgusted with his antics fantastique gave him the knife so
that his wind was let out where his sense had gone. He fell and
fell hard.</p>

<p>Thus did the cunning Tripe fall and pull others down with
him.</p>

<p class="ph3">HOW HE LIVED AND WHY HE DIED</p>


<p>In the first place Willie was unfortunate enough to be born,
in which circumstances he was not unique. He was unfortunate
also in the circumstance that he was born of poor, but dishonest
parents, of that class who spend their lives in a useless struggle
to keep up appearances and prevent their poverty being known
and talked about.</p>

<p>While Willie was unable to talk, the circumstances of his
parents had no effect on him; when nice people called on his
mamma and said how delighted they would be to see the baby,
he was playing on the floor in one garment and none the less
happy that he had no clothes fit to be seen in and that the nice
people had to be told things that were not—that he was out with
the nurse, or asleep or ill. He was fortunate in this.</p>

<p>By and by Willie grew to an age when his surrounding circumstances
began to impress him more or less, and one of the first
impressions he received was that his parents went to a horrible
amount of trouble to appear better off than they were.</p>

<p>When Willie began to go to school he had come to several
conclusions about things and one of the conclusions he had come
to was, that if people took so much trouble, as he saw his parents
do, to appear well off when poorly off, it must be, if not absolutely
wrong at least a grave fault, to be poor, and a fault to be ashamed
of, which of course it is.</p>

<p>Consequently, Willie argued, it is a man’s first business to
become well off. Seek first dollars and all things shall be added
unto you. Many children have this idea and some never get over
it, Willie never got over it.</p>

<p>Willie heard that “anything can be bought,” that “every
man has his price,” that “a man’s best friend is his money,” and
a great many other equally wise and true saws.</p>

<p>So it came about quite naturally that Willie set the dollar up
in his mind as something to be venerated, and overlooked the fact
(quite naturally too) that the dollar is a means to an end not an
end.</p>

<p>Willie’s parents were of the opinion that the next best thing
to having dollars is to make a bold pretense of having them and
Willie was too young to criticize their judgment.</p>

<p>Willie’s father was of the opinion that the most important
thing to attend to in this life was the getting of more dollars than
you need, and that next in importance to that was the adding to
your surplus. Willie saw that his father was a failure in his own
eyes and he saw the mighty struggle he made to hide his failure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Willie was unfortunate in being bright enough to observe
these things and not bright enough to judge wherein they were
poor philosophy.</p>

<p>When Willie was old enough he went into a broker’s office
and there he observed that a great many were the same kind of
people as his pa and his ma, and he made up his mind that
he had to become rich to escape the miseries that trying to be
<span class="allsmcap">SOMEBODY</span> on <span class="allsmcap">NOTHING</span> entailed.</p>

<p>Willie had youthful inclinations, but the fear of poverty had
been so drubbed into him that he curbed all such, promising himself
that he would follow them when he got rich.</p>

<p>Ten years with the brokers gave Willie no liking for the business
or affection for his employers, but he never dreamed of risking
having idle time on his hands earning no money by throwing
up a sure thing for an uncertainty.</p>

<p>He thought of marriage at this time, but put the thought
aside by promising himself the joys of a happy marriage when he
got rich. His close attention to business and saving and cautious
ways gave him a high place in the estimation of his employers,
who now and then “let him into good things” and Willie’s bank
account began to swell and his heart to shrink. He had never
set up in his mind a definite figure to represent riches, but he had
an indefinite idea of something in the neighbourhood of a million
or so. Time did not wait for Willie to get rich, it sped on. Willie
became a partner in his firm, became worth a million, two million,
three million. He buried the other members of his firm, settled
with the widows cheap and became “<span class="allsmcap">THE FIRM</span>” worth more millions.
He forgot all about youthful pleasures, all about marriage,
all about life, all about death, all about everything but dollars;
dollars claimed all his time and thought, everything became
trivial except dollars. Instead of Willie owning the dollars the
dollars began to own him.</p>

<p>Close attention to the business of caring for, watching and
nursing dollars for so long a time at last told so on Willie’s health
that he broke down, his liver, his kidneys, his heart and his lungs
and other unnecessary appendages refused to do business even for
dollars.</p>

<p>Doctors were called in.</p>

<p>Doctors said, “Willie must rest.”</p>

<p>But Willie had never rested, he did not know how to rest.</p>

<p>“Enjoy yourself,” said the doctors, but Willie had never
enjoyed himself.</p>

<p>“No more brain work,” said the doctors, but Willie’s brain
had gained the momentum of constant habit and did business on
its own account. Willie became morbid, brooding over his case;
he could not stop his brain from thinking dollars, he could not
satisfy himself that life was a success—so he blew his dollar-thinking
brains out with an old shot gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>A jury sat on Willie and decided that if a man with Willie’s
millions did not care to live, suicide was justifiable—and commendable.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LOVE_AND_THE_PHILOSOPHER">LOVE AND THE PHILOSOPHER</h2>
</div>


<p>Once upon a time there was a happy Philosopher. He was not
young nor yet was he old. The callowness of youth had passed and
he was in his prime; in fact, he could not have been a philosopher
without being in his prime. He had gained the sobriquet of Philosopher
for the reason that he was known to possess an uncommon
habit of taking facts, those stubborn things, and turning them
over in his mind, examining them and coming to logical conclusions
about them, but it was not the dignity of his name or his
happy peculiarity that made him happy. Philosophy is a very
satisfactory kind of thing, but its pursuit does not bring happiness,
rather is it a drag upon happiness; any fool can be happy, but a
Philosopher has to have reason therefor. Philosophy is a useful
kind of break, preventing happiness from getting too hot and
misery from getting too cold. The Philosopher was happy because
he had been smitten, not smote with a club, but by a girl;
he loved a girl and believed he was loved because the girl told
him he was, which is a good reason for any fellow, but should not
be for a Philosopher.</p>

<p>The Philosopher had never before enjoyed the luxury of love,
so of course he knew nothing about it; it is one of those things
the less you know about it the more enjoyable it is.</p>

<p>The Philosopher could hardly be expected to have the blind
unreasoning love that attacks college freshmen. His love was as
strong and ruling an emotion as a man can suffer; but it was
tempered with reason. He saw the girl as she was; he saw her
shining qualities, her sweetness, generosity, and truthfulness,
dimmed perhaps a little by a will of her own. Truly the girl sometimes
spoke without thought and her mind furniture did not exactly
match the furniture of the Philosopher’s mind; but he
flattered himself that he could alter such small matters and even
looked forward to the time when he could commence moulding
her character to his exact liking. He loved her no less that he
appreciated her faults; a girl would not be perfect without faults;
she is not like a race-horse. One idle afternoon the Philosopher
sat in his study enjoying himself with fancy mental pictures of
the girl while he patiently waited till the clock indicated that he
might go to the girl’s house where, in his imagination, he saw her
waiting as anxious as he. The clock’s hands moved deliberately
forward and finally came to the hour the Philosopher impatiently
waited for, just the same as they would have done in any case.
Time is the only thing that can laugh at love.</p>

<p>Time having liberated the Philosopher, he sped towards the
locus of the girl. As he approached it he became agitated. He
smiled to himself, sighed sighs; his pulse and heart increased their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
rates; he blew his nose, examined his cuffs and gloves, fingered his
cravat, and looked about to see if anyone was observing him.
While he was thus pluming himself he received a severe shock.
He could hardly believe his eyes, but being a Philosopher, of
course he did believe them, and what they revealed to him was—the
girl and another lady coming out of her home and taking a
direction opposite to his. Here was a fact and the Philosopher
immediately began to turn it over in his mind and examine it, at
the same time quickening his gait in pursuit of the girl. The
examination of the bare fact without cross-examination of the girl
was eminently unsatisfactory. The girl knew he was coming at
a certain hour, yet at that hour she went elsewhere. She might
have been unavoidably called away, he told himself; but allowing
that she had been, he argued: “What can excuse her for failing
to look in the direction she knew I must come, to discover if I
was near?” It seemed a small thing to notice against a girl, yet it
seemed to demonstrate that at the time the girl was not thinking
of the Philosopher and the disappointment he was going to receive
by her act. This argued thoughtlessness for other people’s feelings
and a large development of egoism and vanity—“Yes,” said
the girl side of the Philosopher’s mind, “at first blush it would
seem so, but perhaps she is not going out for a long time, and
perhaps she has left word for you or expected to return in time
to meet you.” Thereupon the Philosopher suspended judgment,
but he had received a bad impression. He hurried up and overtook
the girl.</p>

<p>“You might have waited for me,” said the Philosopher, as
he lifted his hat.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the girl, “where did you spring from? Did you
call at the house? I left word for you that I had to go out for
an hour. What makes you look so cross? Wouldn’t you wait for
me an hour?”</p>

<p>The Philosopher answered this array of questions as best he
could. “I am not cross. I was just thinking. Certainly I would
wait for you an hour, if it was necessary.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t think, if you have to look cross,” said the girl.
“I’m so glad you caught us. Miss Gip here called for me to go
with her to meet Mr. Rip on the Golf Links. He has his camera
with him and is going to take us, and besides I want you to meet
Mr. Rip; he is such a nice fellow.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not look to see if I was coming?” the Philosopher
blurted out. He wanted to come to a decision on the facts.</p>

<p>“Now, you’re thinking again, I see by your face,” said the
girl. “I want you to be gay and not always looking for something
to grumble about. I don’t remember whether I looked or
not.”</p>

<p>The Philosopher came to a decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>When the Golf Links were reached Mr. Rip was soon discovered—a
young man with rush of words to the mouth,—who
grated on the nerves of the Philosopher, who knew in a minute
that he and Rip could not both be “such a nice fellow,” which
was rather vain of the Philosopher.</p>

<p>On the way home the Philosopher concluded that to marry
the girl was no fair match; he was a heavy-weight and she was
a feather-weight, no doubt; but no amount of training could train
her up to his weight, or him down to her’s.</p>

<p>So the girl married Rip and made him happy, instead of
marrying the Philosopher and making him unhappy. You must
either be blind to a girl’s failings, or, knowing them, love them
as part of the girl.</p>

<p>A little reason would prevent a lot of people from voting marriage
a failure.</p>

</div>


<p>Long tam ago, when I’m de young feller, I’m work on de
Fire Stashun. I’m pompier on Depôt Nombre Tree on de Faubourg
Quebec. I’m strong lak a beef dose tam, and doant afraid
of notting.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps I have fear for wan ting; yes, fer sure, I have
much afraid of de ole notaire Leblanc, not fer de raison dat he
is more strong as me,—no ba gosh, I’m ver sure I’m give it wan
ponch she’s die right away,—but I’m fear fer de raison dat she
is de fadder of ma belle petite Antoinette.</p>

<p>Ver well, I recollec wat Antoinette lok lak on dat tam. Bagosh
I nevare see de beauty wan lak it. Fer sure she is de bess wan
I doan’t care; juce lak wot you call hangel.</p>

<p>Dats twenty year ago. Now she is big as two hunner pound
and he have de gray hairs on its head; but she’s de good wan
fer me an I can recommember ver well when she is de little ting,
belle comme une ange an can mek de dance lak fairy girl.</p>

<p>I’m ver fond of dat little Antoinette fer sure, but de ole man
Leblanc she’s not lak me ver much. I’m only Pompier on Nombre
Tree: an when one tam she’s see me kiss it several tam de
little Antoinette on de passage she’s get so mad lak a bull, an
trow me off on de house an tell me go pass on de street an doan’t
come back some more. An Antoinette she’s cry lak baby.</p>

<p>Fer sure dats de bad affaire fer me.</p>

<p>I’m ver mad fer de ole man Leblanc, an I’m go on lovin dat
little Antoinette juce lak crazy mans. I can’t eat, I can’t slip, I
can’t do notting fer tink about dat little Antoinette.</p>

<p>After dat of course I see some tam de little Antoinette, on
de sly, an de more I’m see de more I’m crazy; an I tink she’s
lak me purty well too.</p>

<p>One time I speak fer mek de ronne away marriage, but she
doan’t lek fer do dat; she have only seventeen year an me I have
twenty year.</p>

<p>But by me by I have de gran eeday fer finish up de hole
affaire. I’m work on de hook an ladder dat tam. I mek de
bargaine wit de little Antoinette fer little fire on its house
so I can save its life juce fer fun. Ba gosh I’m de most foolishness
young feller on the whole Faubourg Quebec, but de poor
little Antoinette she doan’t fine dat foolish. She tink dat’s de
grande eeday an ver romantique.</p>

<p>Well, I fix hup de hole affaire an de night an de hour arrive
fer de fire on de house of de old Notaire Leblanc. Fer sure I’m
ver excite dat night. De hour come. Ten o’clocks.</p>

<p>I’m walkin up an down an walkin up an down an look de
gong, and expec effery minute she’s goin fer ring, gong! gong!!
No ba gosh she doan’t ring anny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>Five minute, ten minute, fifteen minute ronne away on de
clock an den I get ver quiet, ver tranquil, fer I tink someting
have arreeve so she can’t mek de fire.</p>

<p>Twenty minute pass, twenty-fy minute pass, haff pass ten
an den, Oh mon Dieu wot’s dat? De gong!! she’s sound bang!
Dong! Dong, Dong, Dong, Dong. Dat’s de nombre. Sapristi!
I tink my hart’s goin fur burss wide open.</p>

<p>I’m excite, I’m excite. Hurrah! hurrah!! de hors come out,
de door fly opeen, so slow, so slow. I nevare see de like before.
I yell lak tiger on de driver, “Lick de hors Alphonse, lick de
horse.” I’m hole on de side de hook an ladder an yell, an yell,
an yell like hell. I tink we nevare get dere, an, Saint Esprit!
when we do get dere I wish we have never get dere. Wot do I
see? Mon Dieu! de hole house of de ole Notaire Leblanc en feu,
de flame high on de sky, de smoke so much you can see notting;
de crowd tick like fly, an yell, an yell.</p>

<p>Wot has arreeve dat night I can’t tell; only wan ting, wan
ting, juce de wan ting dats mek me mad, mek me crazy, mek
me tiger, mek me devil.</p>

<p>Wot I’m care fer de house Leblanc? All I can hear is dat
de poor little Antoinette he is in de house. I rosh on de house,
I doan’t hear some ting, I doan’t see some ting, I doan’t feel
some ting. Wot I’m do I nevare can tell. I know only dat I
fine de little Antoinette, my Antoinette, perhaps ded an hang out
de window on de top storee an no way fer pass back de way I
come. But de boys on de hook an ladder, dey doan’t wait long;
de ladder she’s dere so close I can touch wid one han.</p>

<p>I’m strong lak a beef dose tam, but when I tek de little
Antoinette on one harm an reach fer de ladder, hot lak a furnace,
an swing masef an de little Antoinette out de window I know den
I’m strong, strong lak twenty plow hors.</p>

<p>An den I know notting fer tree day, an when I’m ope de eye
I’m in de osspital an cover all over wit bandage; an de firs ting

<p>Oh, bagosh!! I tell you dis little histoire, but you bet my life

    <div class="verse indent0">He knocked upon the green baise door</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And in his card he sent.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, when he saw the minister,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He nailed him with a look,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And put the bill before his face</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And talked just like a book.</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">It don’t give me a cent.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Why, really,” said the minister,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And so another bill was made</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Just in the same old way—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That is, with plenty words,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The clerk got very little pay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But still he had the honour left</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of working for the King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which although it doesn’t pay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Is a genteel kind of thing.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The minister was not to blame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He did not give it thought—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fact is, he didn’t know as much</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">About the matter as he ought.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whatever he set out to do</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Was sure to do by guess,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because of C. S. he knew little,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And cared a little less.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The minister was not alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In his ignorance dark as night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All the members of the House</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Were just in the same plight.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You know, dear reader, that the House</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Has many things to Do;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And it cannot think of them</div>

<p>Two old widows and an old maid, who had existed much
longer than was necessary for the comfort and well being of the
community wherein they dwelt, sat beside a comfortable grate
fire furnished by Life Insurance, drinking tea, eating muffins and
discussing Man.</p>

<p>A young married woman was also present but she did not
count.</p>

<p>“I met that odious Mr. Blank down town to-day,” said Mrs.
Gabb, the widow who was providing the good cheer, “and do you
know he stares every woman he sees out of countenance.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Blabb, the other widow, “Blank is just like
all the men; everyone knows him, but his poor wife.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my gracious goodness,” exclaimed the ancient maid,
whose name was Slabb, “is Mr. Blank such a dreadful man?
What did <span class="allsmcap">HE</span> do?” And she hoped that poor Blank had done
something dreadful and wicked so that she could hear about it.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t done anything that I can hear about,” said Gabb,
“but that does not make him any better. The way he looks is
enough for me. I know him; I know him; he is a very fast man.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Blank seems a very nice man to me,” ventured the
young married woman meekly.</p>

<p>“That’s it, my dear,” said Gabb; “of course he seems nice,
lots of them seem nice, but you are young; wait till you are as old
as we are and you will discover that a man is not to be trusted
because he <span class="allsmcap">SEEMS</span> nice.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am sure,” said the newly married woman, “I can
trust my Willie. He tells me everything and is the most truthful
man I ever knew.”</p>

<p>The Three Has Beens smiled in unison.</p>

<p>“I thought as you do,” said Blabb. “Mr. Blabb was a very
fine man in many ways, but he certainly could put Annanias and
Sapphira in the cool shade when he found it expedient; and he
was an awful man. You see they always commence by getting
up a reputation for veracity, so they can tell you anything.”</p>

<p>“Although I have never been married, thank the Lord, I
must say I have seen enough of men to know that they are dreadfully
untruthful,” said Slabb, and she shivered in a way to suggest
that the very idea of a man gave her a cold chill, while everyone
knew that her single state was no fault of hers and she would
give her eyes to call anything in the shape of a man <span class="allsmcap">MINE</span>.</p>

<p>The young married woman went home thoughtful, the poison
working in her mind. She wept a little and wondered how much
truth there was in that she had heard, and if Willie was really
what he seemed.</p>

<p>Blessed are the pure in heart.</p>

</div>


<p>A certain merchant who had risen from zero to four or five
hundred thousand, was filled with the idea that he was self-made.</p>

<p>The idea increased until he was not only filled with it, but he
overflowed so that he lost no opportunity to put his thumb in the
arm-hole of his vest, throw out his chest and tell people how much
patience, perseverance, energy and will power he had exerted to
make himself.</p>

<p>He took much pleasure in smiling superior smiles at the
young, striving and unsuccessful, and in relating how, unaided
he had risen from an undershirt and trousers to a dress suit at
dinner.</p>

<p>One evening the merchant was lounging in his library, smoking
his perfecto and composing peans of praise to himself, when
he became aware of the presence of an entity which stood before
him regarding him with an amused expression of countenance.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” said the merchant.</p>

<p>“I am Circumstances; I alter cases,” said the Entity.</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed,” said the merchant, “do you want to see me?”</p>

<p>“I am forced to take cognizance of you,” replied the Entity.</p>

<p>“Well, but what can I do for you? What is your business
with me?” asked the merchant.</p>

<p>“You can do nothing for me,” replied the Entity; “but I
can do much for you and have done much.”</p>

<p>“You must be making a mistake,” said the merchant. “You
are in the wrong house. I never had any cases altered and I don’t
need any altered now. Go away, please, I do not know you.”</p>

<p>“Yet I made you,” said the Entity.</p>

<p>“Pooh! pooh! nonsense,” said the merchant, “you must be
a stranger hereabouts; everyone knows I am a self-made man.”</p>

<p>“A self-made fool,” said the Entity, “your memory is short
and your vanity great. Do you remember the strike that took
place when you were in the undershirt and trousers period of
your life?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” slowly replied the merchant, a little flurried to hear
a stranger go back so far into his history.</p>

<p>“Well I made that strike case, and only for that case you
would have starved to death. You became a scab workman by
taking advantage of me.”</p>

<p>“Really,” said the merchant.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued the Entity, “you remember your quick
promotion; how you rose to be foreman?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” quickly interrupted the merchant, “but you know that
I was eminently fit for the position.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“Of course you were fit,” answered the Entity, “but ’twas I
who made you fit and I made the case. What good would your
fitness have been without the case?”</p>

<p>“Well, but my dear fellow,” commenced the merchant.</p>

<p>“Don’t ‘well but,’ and ‘dear fellow’ me,” interrupted the
Entity, “the war that laid the foundation of your fortunes was my
doing. You must admit that I made you or I am done with you.”</p>

<p>“I will not admit anything of the kind,” hotly replied the
merchant.</p>

<p>Immediately the Entity became invisible. His sudden disappearance
rather shook the self-confidence of the merchant, but
a few hundred thousand makes a man very brave and assertive.</p>

<p>The merchant thought no more of his experience till he
went to his office and discovered that his trusted manager had
eloped with his daughter after having used up various negotiable
securities. Then something seemed to tell the merchant that
Circumstances had to be taken into consideration. And more
lessons were forthcoming, for Circumstances altered so many cases
that the merchant did not expect to be altered that he was
finally reduced to his undershirt and trousers again. The front
door of the merchant’s house banged furiously and the merchant
awoke to the fact that he had been dozing on the lounge of his
own comfortable library with the cat asleep on his chest.</p>

<p>He patted and stroked the cat kindly and thought a few
thoughts that did him a great deal of good.</p>

<p>When the merchant’s cat had kittens, the one that was not
drowned was christened Circumstance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_EVOLUTION_OF_ALEXANDER">THE EVOLUTION OF ALEXANDER</h2>
</div>


<p>A certain man owned the name of Mike. While very young
he had been brought from Mikeland, with a lot of other little
Mikelanders, by a kind lady who made a very handsome living in
a genteel kind of slave trade.</p>

<p>Immediately upon his arrival in America, Mike was rented
by the kind lady to another equally kind lady, who needed cheap
help.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this inauspicious start in life, Mike made
his way; he ran away from the kind lady who wanted cheap help
and struggled up to manhood unaided by similar philanthropists.</p>

<p>There were washerwomen in those days; Mike married one,
putting into the partnership, as offset to the washboard skill of his
wife, a horse and cart that were not new.</p>

<p>Although Mike could neither read nor write; although he
made his living by odd carting and by delivering clothes (which
Mrs. Mike had washed) to the owners, and although he was not
known to be entitled to any other name than “Mike”; he was
proud and ambitious. He had no ancestors to be proud of that
he knew of, so he was proud of himself, and his ambition was
for his son, Michael, and he declared that “an eddication he
should have, so he should.” So Michael, the son of Mike, was
instructed in the mysteries of “readin’, ’ritin’ and figgerin’,”
which were the length, breadth and depth of “eddication” to the
idea of Mike.</p>

<p>Michael fulfilled the ambitions of his father.</p>

<p>Whether Michael profited more by the practical instruction
he gathered from his father relative to horses, truck driving and
general carting, or by his “eddication” it is unnecessary to conclude.
Suffice it to relate, that by some means or other, and by
attaining a high proficiency as a liar, he made a large fortune as a
horse dealer, trader, stealer and manipulator.</p>

<p>Michael had an eye like a hawk. That is to say, he was a keen
observer of things, which is perhaps superfluous information considering
that he made a fortune; but his perceptive faculties were
keen in other directions than those necessary to get other people’s
money and keep it; consequently he observed that in society,
whereunto he had sunk by the weight of his wealth, he was at a
disadvantage on account of his ignorance. The “ould man”
Mike, looked up to Michael as a marvel of erudition; but Michael,
although he did not know even what erudition was, knew that
education was not his. He knew he was ignorant, but he held
up his head and kept his mouth shut, which is one kind of wisdom,
and he made a very fair show even if he was forced to be
silent when people talked of things other than horses and dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>Privately Michael was of the opinion that Shakespeare was
“outrageous,” that there was no music without a “chune” to it;
that the craze for old china was “a regular fake,” that Japanese
bric-a-brac were the worst he ever saw, and that most pictures
that society raved about, and the “old masters” in particular,
“bate the Dutch,” but he never said a word. He never bluffed,
so he never was called.</p>

<p>Alexander transpires at this point. Unto Mr. and Mrs. Michael
was born one son, and they called him Alexander, no doubt hoping
that he would be great. Alexander was carefully brought up
among all the luxuries that dollars can purchase; of course the
aforesaid luxuries had a newness about them which might be
painful to the highly cultured; this was to be expected. Dollars,
although they can purchase everything that goes to make luxury,
cannot supply taste.</p>

<p>Michael worshipped education as his father before him had
done, and he decided that “Alexander should have an education
that would ‘knock’ the tar out of any education that ever was
bought for money.” Michael was ignorant of the fact that education
is still a very uncertain quantity, and that even experts
do not agree on what is necessary to constitute it.</p>

<p>Alexander inherited his father’s intelligence and soaked up
his education very readily. The details of his education are unessential
to this tale. It is enough to state that he got it, as it is
generally thought a gentleman should, through school, college
and travel, and at twenty-two he was, as his father expressed it,
“educated up to the handle.”</p>

<p>Alexander’s education bore fruit. The kind of fruit an education
will bear depends much upon what kind of an education is
planted and the ground it falls on. Michael expected that Alexander’s
education would bear fruit. What fruit he wished for or
expected it is impossible to surmise, for he never expressed his
wishes or hopes; not being a judge of educational fruit his ideas
on the subject were probably rather vague. Alexander shone in
society for a year or two, much to his father’s delight, but at the
end of that time his shining was no longer a novelty and was very
expensive for Michael.</p>

<p>Michael decided to take his son into the horse business, which
was still flourishing like a palm tree, or a Cedar of Lebanon; he
also decided that he should marry.</p>

<p>A very nice family which had very small means had a very
nice daughter for sale; Michael bought her for his son. So these
were wed. Big show wedding and honeymoon trip very expensive
for Michael.</p>

<p>When Alexander returned from his wedding trip he balked
on the horse business. “His wife was of such a nice family you
know,” and besides, “it is such a damnably plebian business,
don’t you know.” Michael interviewed Alexander in his library,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
in which were displayed a large number of beautiful books, bran
new, and the result of the interview was that an occupation was
agreed upon for Alexander. He became a stock broker. Seat
on Stock Exchange and swell office, very expensive for Michael.</p>

<p>Alexander among stock gamblers and jobbers was like a lamb
within the shambles. The motto of stock speculators is not “Love
your neighbor as yourself,” but is “Strike lest ye be struck.”
Alexander was struck many times and hard. He learned the business,
but unfortunately for him, just about the time that he was
beginning to consider that he knew the business he was cornered
and crushed. He failed for an amount which was worth mentioning,
which, of course, was very expensive for Michael. After
the failure Alexander consented to knuckle down to the horse
business, and about this time Michael began to give notes where
formerly he had given checks. Alexander was of the opinion that
he was now an experienced business man, but he wasn’t, and he
proved no addition to the horse business. Soon Michael began to
ask for renewal on notes and things began to be said about him;
no man has credit so good that he can afford to have things said
about him. So Michael called a meeting of his creditors, and the
estate was so bad that fine house, furniture, horses and carriages
and everything that went to make the luxurious home were swept
away. Everyone blamed Alexander for the ruin of his father,
that is, everyone but Michael himself. Michael’s views were expressed
neatly and characteristically in a speech to his creditors
thusly:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, me son can tell ye all why ‘telegram’ is no proper
word to use because its against the rules and regulations of
strict etymology; he can tell ye all a lot of other things that ye
don’t know, ner me neither, but he does not understand money.
I made a mistake in the education of me son, I neglected that
branch of education which deals with the science of making and
saving money and keepin’ it when ye get it. Me son is a fine
spender, he was educated that way; I think I can offer ye twelve
cents on the dollar.”</p>

<p>Michael is now slowly rising from his ashes as those who fit
their environment must. Alexander is sinking in the outer darkness
of the unfit.</p>

<p>As ye sow so also shall others reap.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PEACE">PEACE</h2>
</div>


<p>Once upon a time, a long while ago, when such things could
be, came a young man of thirty-five years of age unto his friend,
who was a politician—Big Indian, and “High Up”—and the young
man spoke unto the Politician, saying: “Friend, for twenty
years have I striven and strove; I have cut hay; I have hewed
wood; I have laboured in the vineyard; I’ve made things with my
hands, and schemed with my head; I have gone up against many
games and fought for the wherewithal to keep a family and clothes
upon my back. Now I am tired and would pass my remaining
days in peace. Therefore, I pray thee order it so that I may have
a Government Job and be happy.”</p>

<p>And the Politician questioned the young man and asked:
“<i>Peace</i>? Did’st say that thou wouldst have Peace?”</p>

<p>And the young man answered and said, “I wouldst.”</p>

<p>And the Politician said: “You know not what you ask. Peace
never accomplished anything, and is not for the active-minded.
You do not understand life if you desire Peace.”</p>

<p>But the young man harkened not to the Politician, but
pressed his request for a Government Job.</p>

<p>And it was so, even within a few months, the young man
found himself a Civil Servant with regular employment and a
small, but regular, income.</p>

<p>And years rolled on, as usual, until the young man became
nearly elderly; yea, for twelve years he plugged and said unto
himself: “Truly this is not exciting or elevating, but it is the
sure thing that my heart craved, and I should be satisfied and
happy.” But the wise know that the “Should Bes” and the
“Ises” do not balance; and the young man woke up to the fact
that at forty-seven years of age he was neither satisfied nor happy,
although he was willing to admit that he should be.</p>

<p>And it came to pass that as the young man sat in his office,
working for the King, by punching holes in documents, that they
might be strung on a file; on the twelfth anniversary of his conversation
with his friend, the Politician, a great light broke upon
him, and he saw the wisdom of the talk of the Politician. He
looked about his office, and peered backward over the past twelve
years, and he saw that he had had Peace in large bunches, and
by the mile—yea, by the year and day—and he found that it was
not in his heart to feel glad with his peaceful experience, and he
reasoned with himself and said: “In a short fifteen years I will
be in the Has Been class. I will have whiskers in my ears and
my back will be humped and moss-grown. I’ll be a back number,
and be as a dead one; therefore, it behooveth me to get busy and
do something worth while lest I get mental dry rot and be as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
beast of the field. Peace I desired, and now that I have found
it, it satisfieth me not, but is a burden and ashes in the mouth.”
And thereupon he arose and got out and went against the world
amidst those who were in the great struggle. And the world
smote him and threw him down and swat him, hip and thigh, right
and left; but he became patient and wary, and he husbanded
his strength and sparred for an opening and kept cool; and, behold,
in a little while came an opportunity unto him, and he up
and grasped it and made it his, and he played the game so that
others were ’ware of him, and the world bowed down to him,

<p>My son, beware of the soft voice of the petticoat.</p>

<p>The petticoat is full of guile and maketh even the strong go
astray, while the weak she considereth as her’s always.</p>

<p>It smileth and smileth when it weepeth not, and in both tears
and smiles it bodeth no good to man.</p>

<p>It leadeth thee along the stoney path and jeereth at thee if
thou remark thy bleeding feet.</p>

<p>It looketh toward darkness and declareth that there is the
light of Hope and seeth darkness where there is only light.</p>

<p>It believeth in signs and omens and would hand thee bound
hand and foot into the hands of the Church.</p>

<p>It beguileth thee into discounting the future and revileth thee
when its counsels have brought thee to harm.</p>

<p>It inviteth thee to Vanity and the ways of the boastful; it
falleth down and worshipeth at the shrine of the Golden Calf, and
constraineth thee to do likewise.</p>

<p>It selleth what should be given and giveth what should be
sold.</p>

<p>It beareth thee children as is its nature to do, and then
boasteth thereof; it refuseth to bear and boasteth of that also.</p>

<p>It beareth thy successes with smiling equanimity, and tearfully
upbraideth thee with thy failures.</p>

<p>It is short of sight and dull of apprehension and of logic and
consistency knoweth naught.</p>

<p>It playeth merry hell with thy nerves, and beareth thee away
in triumph lest thou are exceeding careful.</p>

<p>It liveth in the present only and is a sluggard.</p>

<p>It maketh of thee a <span class="allsmcap">LIAR</span> in self-defence.</p>

<p>It is of a jealous and suspicious mind and crieth aloud
“Wolf, Wolf,” when there is no wolf, and seeth nothing of the
danger that is imminent.</p>

<p>It gaineth nothing from experience, but persisteth in the ways
of folly.</p>

<p>It knoweth nothing of justice and bendeth the easy knee to
conventionality.</p>

<p>It is short in the heels and its equilibrium is unstable, and
when it falleth it declareth loudly that it was pushed.</p>

<p>It declareth evil of its own kind and giveth the glad hand
and merry face to the deceiver.</p>

<p>It rejoiceth much in scandal and maketh thy secrets public.</p>

<p>It knoweth things that are not so and denieth stoutly against
facts.</p>

<p>It fawneth upon the strong arm and enslaveth the meek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>The henpecked is a laughing stock to his fellows, and the
Petticoat rejoiceth thereat.</p>

<p>Look not upon the Petticoat when the wind bloweth; and
when it rustleth seductively, harken not.</p>

<p>It putteth on clothes in manner and shape which is a reproach
to common sense.</p>

<p>Better that thou put a mill stone about thy neck and straightway
leap into deep water than put thyself under the dominion of
the Petticoat, for it ruleth with a rod of iron and without discretion;
it putteth a yoke upon thy shoulders which galleth forever.</p>

</div>


<p>Once upon a time the King of Spades got it into his head
that he was the Whole Thing and by his vanity made himself
very objectionable to the rest of the Pack. He became thoroughly
confirmed in his high opinion of himself, when one evening he,
with a couple of other Kings and a pair of deuces, beat a Queen
Full on Aces.</p>

<p>His boasting became so tiresome that everyone gave him a
wide berth and he frequently found himself in the Discard. This
did not cure him, however, and he continued to be boastful,
bragging of the great hands he had been in and the Queens he
had captured until all the cards up to the nines left the Pack,
leaving him in a Euchre Deck where he was nightly captured by
Knaves.</p>

<p>Finally, he got so low, dirty, greasy and disreputable, that he
represented the dark man in the pack the cook used to tell fortunes
with.</p>

<p>Bragging is such an objectionable form of vanity that even a
King cannot afford to indulge in it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_REVOLT_OF_JOHNS">THE REVOLT OF JOHNS</h2>
</div>


<p>One morning Johns went down to his office, opened his diary
at the proper date, and wrote therein as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“This day I have decided things.”</p>
</div>

<p>No one reading this could possibly understand to what it referred,
or what bearing it had on Johns, or his surroundings. Even
if Mrs. Johns, who considered herself a very shrewd and far-seeing
woman, had seen it, it would have meant nothing, unless
she could have read Johns’ mind, which she did sometimes—at
least she claimed she did.</p>

<p>Johns, after writing the above as stated, looked it over
thoughtfully, and smiling a sad smile, murmured to himself, “I
wonder if I can do it without too much friction.”</p>

<p>The facts in Johns’ life which led up to his making the mysterious
entry in his diary were his marriage, and all the happenings
of three years of married life with the well meaning, rather
charming, but somewhat obstreperous Mrs. Johns.</p>

<p>Fact is, Johns had begun to realize that he was henpecked,
and had decided to reform. For three years he had systematically
spoiled Mrs. Johns to such an extent that she was unhappy. She
wept because she had, like Alexander, no more worlds to conquer.
She had developed into a very talkative autocrat, or tyrant,
or something very much like that. She invaded every department
of Johns’ life, regulated his smoking, drinking, eating, sleeping,
clothing, and even his speech. Johns habitually dropped his
“G’s” and Mrs. Johns habitually picked them up for him. Before
going out to spend an evening Mrs. Johns gave Johns very explicit
instructions relative to what he was to say to this one, that one
and the other one, and exact details of what he was not to say;
then on the return home Mrs. Johns would carefully point out the
many lapses she considered Johns had made and warned him
against like breaks.</p>

<p>Johns was pitied and despised by his former associates, and
people smiled when Mrs. Johns said, “Jack, dear,” and Johns
said, “Yes, my dear.” He was down and out; at least, it looked
like it until he wrote: “This day I have decided things,” in his
diary.</p>

<p>It would be wrong to conclude from the foregoing that Johns
was a meek, pusilanimous, undersized, gentle and delicate man,
without will or energy. Such was not the case. Meekness was
not in him. He weighed 13 stone 3, stood 6 feet “in his stockings,”
wore a 7 hat, a 9 shoe, and showed decision and pluck in business.
But he loved peace to such an extent that he would sacrifice
nearly anything to procure it, and so he had come to make
the mistake of spoiling Mrs. Johns by deferring to her in absolutely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
everything, in the fond belief that thereby he was making
home peaceful. After a three years’ experiment in this direction
he became wise to the fact that peace was not his.</p>

<p>Johns, among men, had always been called a “good fellow,”
and he was a good fellow; but not so good that he was an ass like
some so-called good fellows. He was easy going and good natured;
but not the type of the henpecked husband. He was a bad man
to corner.</p>

<p>It must not be concluded either that Mrs. Johns was a vixen
or a virago. No; she was simply a woman who had been made
too much of; one whose path had been made so smooth that
she had never been forced to think very much about anything;
one who had received no training whatever in her development
from a loving and gentle maiden to the equally beautiful, but
somewhat sterner, married woman of three years’ standing. Possibly
also she had been badly advised by sundry old women of her
family who were satisfied that they were authorities on the management
of a husband, and that they knew all about the animal
man and his varieties. Mrs. Johns was also influenced in her
method with Johns by what she had seen in her own home, where
her calm and dignified, but rather shallow, mother walked on
all the rights and liberties of her father, who only claimed his
own soul by stealth.</p>

<p>The foregoing is, of course, commonplace enough. Married
people are to be seen on all sides dragging out a miserable existence,
just for want of a little thought about the real cause of their
wretchedness. Johns did not propose to be of the many. He
had given the matter thought and saw wherein he was himself to
blame for the discomfort in his life. He decided to make a change,
and as a preliminary wrote in his diary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“This day I have decided things.”</p>
</div>

<p>The business of the day being done, Johns started for home.
On the way he bought himself a hat, and put it on. He had never
bought a hat since he was married, without the style, price and
color, being passed on by Mrs. Johns. He dropped into his club,
played a game of bridge and had a glass of wine with a friend,
much to the astonishment of the boys; for all these things were
known to be objectionable to Mrs. Johns. If Johns’ name was
mentioned in club circles, men smiled and said he had taken the
veil. Leaving the club, Johns took a hansom and drove home,
smoking a cigar, which hansom and cigar were other things objectionable
to Mrs. Johns.</p>

<p>At first thought, the behavior of Johns may seem to have
been positively brutal, in doing with malice prepense so many
things objectionable to his wife. But there was some wisdom
in his course, as will appear.</p>

<p>To relate such an incident as the action of Johns in the hearing
of ladies would be productive of sundry indignant sniffs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
snorts, and such remarks as, “I would like to have seen him try
it on me;” but the sniffs, snorts and remarks would all come from
the same type of women—old stagers, not young, inexperienced
things, like Mrs. Johns, just turned twenty-three.</p>

<p>When Johns arrived at his home, Mrs. Johns was on the verandah
waiting. She was not looking very agreeable, for Johns
was late for dinner—an unpardonable offence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Johns saw the cigar, saw the hansom, saw the hat,
smelled the wine as Johns kissed her, and saw the time by her
tiny wrist watch. Her first impression was that Johns was intoxicated;
but a second look into his eye, and a consideration of
his general bearing, told her he was quite sober. She was quite
perplexed, non-plused, and, in consequence, mad, very mad, and
hurt, too. Beyond all, however, she was curious to know what it
all meant. She concluded, finally, that Johns had met one of
his horrid former friends, and had been “showing off.”</p>

<p>Mrs. and Mr. Johns, like well-behaved people, walked silently
and decorously into dinner and sat down, both thoughtful. Johns
had nothing to say, until cross-examination opened by the plaintiff.
Mrs. Johns had lots to say; but was undecided where to
commence in order to make the most of her efforts. She did not
wish to seem puzzled or curious, so refrained from asking questions.
She sullenly waited, hoping that Johns would venture to
report and offer explanations, thus giving her an opening. But
Johns did nothing of the kind. He silently and complacently proceeded
to take his soup, which was very exasperating, altogether
too much, in fact, for Mrs. Johns, who finally cast discretion to
the winds and allowed her pent-up anger to have its way. She
stormed and raved, and abused poor Johns till she was spent,
Johns meanwhile making vain attempts to calm her and explain
just in the way he had planned to do; but he got no chance till
Mrs. Johns broke down and gave way to tears. Then Johns explained
how he had been thinking about the many things his wife
worried herself with, and how he had decided that she had too
much to think of; and that he had done all the things he ought
not to have done, like the miserable sinner mentioned in the
prayer book, just to illustrate the number of things she was attempting
to regulate, all to no end, because she only made him
uncomfortable and failed to achieve happiness for herself. He
put the matter very nicely and coolly, without losing his temper;
but the kind of oil he attempted to throw on the troubled waters
of Mrs. Johns’ temper did not seem to be the right kind of oil, for
she waxed frantic under his disclosures, and said things of all
kinds, many of them quite untrue, among which last she said that
she did not love Johns, never did love him, and never would; that
she despised him; that he was a low, uncouth, and uncultured
brute, and that it was only for the sake of appearances that she
had remained with him and tried to make him fit for polite society,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
and that he was just like other men, selfish and thoughtless after
a few years’ marriage.</p>

<p>Women say this kind of thing every day to men whom they
worship, and never expect to be taken at par and never should
be. The value of a statement by a woman is entirely different
to the value of a statement by a man.</p>

<p>At this point Johns made a grave mistake. He took his wife’s
intemperate utterances at par. He was deeply grieved to learn
what he thought was the real condition of her mind, and, believing,
that all happiness was gone for him, and that there was no
use continuing the painful scene, he made for his hat, intending
to leave the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Johns, seeing his move, ran to him and clung about his
neck, saying: “Don’t go out Jack; please don’t go; you have
never done this before; stay and be what you have always been
to me; forgive me for saying such wicked things; they are not
true, Jack; I do not mean them at all.”</p>

<p>Here Johns made another mistake, he thought it was all
over. He assured his wife that he loved her, and received like
assurances from her. He kissed her, and she tossed his hair with
loving fingers and smiled. Then as they sat together on a tete-a-tete
sofa in the drawing room she sweetly said: “Now, John,
promise me that you will never do anything like that again. You
know I am always right about things, and so promise me that
you will never go to the club again, or smoke horrid cigars, or
play cards, or drink wine, or be late for dinner, or wear clothes I
do not like, or, or, or anything.” Johns paused. If he had said,
“Yes, dear,” he would have been ruined for life, and Mrs. Johns
would have loved him less and less as years went by, and would
have despised him always; but he did not say, “Yes, dear.” On
the contrary, he said, “No, dear; I cannot promise so much.”
And he explained as well as he could why he could not make
foolish blanket promises, covering all his future life in all its
petty details, and he tried to make her see how unreasonable
she would be to insist on such a demand promissory note. He
exampled husbands she knew, who notoriously hood-winked and
humbugged their wives with wicked and foolish lies, because they
were afraid to be themselves. He pictured to her the forlorn
state of her father as a horrible specimen of petticoat government.
He was eloquent, and he thought convincing, in his plea
for some liberty. If Mrs. Johns had had half the common sense
she prided herself on having, she would have accepted his explanation.
She would have seen that it was just as foolish to expect
to manage all the details of a man’s doings, comings and
goings, wearings and tastes, as it would be for a man to offer to
do the same for a woman; but, of course, no person, man or
woman, is quite as wise as they believe themselves to be, and
besides, Mrs. Johns was still mad and thought she was in a contest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
for her liberty, instead of seeing that she was attacking her
husband’s liberty. She became cold and dignified, and calmly
told Johns that he was a calculating, unsympathetic brute, and
that she would forthwith return to her ma.</p>

<p>Johns begged her not to be hasty. He prayed her to think it
over; but he was forced by the stubborn, spoiled woman, to
choose between a general promise to give up all liberty of thought,
speech and action, or allow her to go back to her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Johns, without delay or preparation, went to her mother,
and remained exactly eight days, receiving during that time eight
letters from Johns; but refraining from reply.</p>

<p>During these eight days Mrs. Johns made great progress in
wisdom. She made many useful discoveries, and thought much.
She discovered that living with mother was not half as pleasant
as living with Johns; that home was not what it used to be in her
single days; that mother was very self-opinionated; that Johns
could write much more interesting letters than she thought he
could; that there are several kinds of love and several kinds of
love letters; and that Johns knew how to write them all; that
Johns was not so pliable as she had imagined he was; and that,
anyway, she would rather love a man who had character enough to
assert himself than a weakling.</p>

<p>On the eighth day of her separation from Johns, Mrs. Johns
was sitting alone in her mother’s drawing room in the dusk of
the evening musing on things in general, on her lot in particular,
and on the revolt of Johns. She had the last letter from Johns
tightly clasped in her hand, and she surprised herself saying
aloud, “Poor Jack.” A week prior she would have murmured,
“Poor me.” She was also surprised to feel tear drops in her
eyes, and to find that resentment against Johns had no more
place in her heart. She knelt down by the grate fire, and by its
light she noticed the time on her wrist watch—half-past five. If
she had been at her own home, Jack would be in or just coming
in; he would be putting his arm around her and kissing her.
What had he done, anyway, that was so dreadful, that she should
leave him? He was certainly the best behaved man she knew.
What was he doing now?</p>

<p>A sudden impulse seized her. She rushed to her room, and
hastily donned a wrap, and hurried out towards her own home,
wondering what she was going to do, what she was going to say,
and what she was going to see; but nothing seemed to matter except
that she must see Jack.</p>

<p>As she neared the familiar door she automatically put her
hand into her bag for her key. It was there. Trembling now and
eager, she opened the door and slipped in. All was quiet. Without
expecting to see any one, she pushed her head between the
portieres of the drawing room door, and peeped in. Horrors!
Some one was there, and looking right at her. What Mrs. Johns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
saw was certainly unexpected and disconcerting. It was big Jack
Johns, lying stretched on the best sofa, his head bolstered with
the best sofa pillows, and puffing clouds of smoke from a pipe
about her lovely drawing room. What she said was, “Why,
Jack!” and Jack said, “You, Florry! Have you come back to
hubby to be a good girl?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Johns’ reply was tears for a few seconds. Then she
said: “Oh, Jack, I thought I could come back; but I see I
cannot, because you do not love me or you would never have
smoked in my drawing room, put your feet on the sofa, and your
head on the best sofa pillows in the house.” Johns, now sitting
up, laughed, drew his wife down beside him on the sofa and replied:</p>

<p>“Why, darling, it would be as wise for me to say that you
do not love me or you would not mention such things as sofa
cushions and sofas in the same breath with love. What does
anything matter, dear, if two people love each other? If you
love me, it is because I am myself, as I love you because you are
your own dear self. I love you, faults and all, and you must
love me faults and all, too. The way for us to be happy is for
each to allow the other nearly as much liberty as though we were
single. Love cannot stand continuous worry about small things.
You know very well that I would not have desecrated your drawing
room had you been here; but you being gone from me, drawing
room, cushions or sofa had no value to me, other than the
comfort they could afford me. Come now, is it a new start?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, you do not understand,” said Mrs. Johns. “But
I do understand,” replied Johns. “I understand very plainly,
indeed, that we could never be happy in the way we were going.
I could not be happy in one continued round of obeying orders,
so like a private in a regiment of soldiers; and you could not be
happy with a man you had to worry over and fuss about all the
time as if he were a child. In that way we would worry each
other out of all comfort in life, as I see many couples foolishly
do. Let us be different from other couples.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Johns was thinking: “Where have you been, Jack, the
last eight nights?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Why, I do not remember, dear, exactly;” answered Johns,
“to the club mostly, and down town and around.”</p>

<p>“There, I knew it,” cried Mrs. Johns, “I knew you had been
around, and you know how I hate men who go around.”</p>

<p>“But don’t be hasty, dear,” said Johns. “Where have you
been? Have you not been around during the past eight days?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have, Jack, but you know a woman’s around, and
a man’s around, are not alike,” sobbed Mrs. Johns.</p>

<p>“No; no more than their clothes are alike, thank heaven,”
said Johns.</p>

<p>“And where is the maid?” asked Mrs. Johns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“Fired,” replied Johns.</p>

<p>“Discharged!” exclaimed Mrs. Johns. “Oh, Jack, you are
dreadful. Where will I get another? You are turning out so
different to what you used to be; so different to what I expected.
I don’t believe I love you any more.”</p>

<p>“Try a little,” said Johns, kissing her without her offering
much resistance. “Try,” kisses, “try again,” more kisses. Oh,
it was disgusting the way she gave in.</p>

<p>“You are different too, dear;” continued Johns, “so different
from the pliable, unsophisticated young thing of twenty I courted.
At twenty-three you are quite old and domineering, and it does
not become you a bit to become domineering. It makes lines on
your face to be domineering. Will we go down to the cafe for
dinner?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, John.” “Well, I know,” said Johns. “Go
and get your things on and we will take dinner at the Place Viger,
anyway, without conditions; perhaps people have begun to talk
already about your being away.”</p>

<p>“Jack,” said Mrs. Johns, with arms about his neck, “you
are a horrid, practical beast, and I love you. I’ll be back in a
minute,” and she ran upstairs to dress for dinner at the Place
Viger. She was a dear woman, and Johns knew it.</p>

<p>Twenty years have passed since that dinner at the Place
Viger, and Mrs. Johns has now assorted little Johns; six, from 2
feet high to 5 feet 6; and all Johns’ friends swear she is the best
fellow in the world, and all her own friends say she is a charming
hostess, a good wife, a fond mother, a sweet woman, or a true
friend, according to the degree of intimacy they enjoy. Fact is,
she is all of these things.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_IDIOT_WHO_THOUGHT">THE IDIOT WHO THOUGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">A PRESENT DAY TRAGEDY</p>

<p class="ph4">BY VON LUDWIG</p>


<p>Once upon a time there was an idiot who had a few brains
and in an unlucky moment he started to think, which is a very
idiotic thing to do, as every one knows. The way to live peacefully
is not to think, but just to grab everything that you want
that is grabable, eat well, sleep well, work a little, but do not, on
any account, think. It is bad; it is conducive to thoughts; and
thoughts worry; and worry is indigestion; and indigestion is bad
humour; and then peace is gone. Peace is the only thing that is
worth anything and you cannot have it if you have thoughts.</p>

<p>Now this idiot was, of course, married,—a great many idiots
are. His wife was a very wise lady idiot: she was undoubtedly
nice because all the idiots she was idiot enough to entertain said
she was a charming hostess. Well, the idiot and his wife retired
to rest one night as usual; the wife to read the latest novel and
the idiot to stare at the wall paper until sleep overcame him. As
he stared at the wall paper he wondered at its ugliness, and he
wondered why people who design wall papers make wondrous
geometrical vines bearing fretwork tarts and lobster claws which
worry one’s sight, instead of soothing, real things. And these
musings led to other musings and he closed his eyes and looked
inwardly for a minute and was horrified to discover that he himself
was very much after the style of the wall paper design;—in
that he was distorted by conventionality. And here he started
to think hard, and the more he thought the more he was horrified.
Finally, he sat up in bed and said suddenly to his wife:</p>

<p>“Do you know, Spot,” (her pet name was Spot), “I have
been thinking—”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly, dear,” responded Spot. “Go to sleep, if
you don’t take care you will have ideas.”</p>

<p>But the idiot was not to be put off that way this time; the
warning was too late, he had commenced to have ideas and very
unpleasant ideas, too. One horrible idea that had forced its unpleasant
presence into his brain was that his whole system of
life had been and was wrong. He thought of his marriage,—how
he had married the girl of his choice on $750 a year, and spent
$300 on his wedding trip. That was a wrong to the girl and to
himself, for when they got back they had to finish furnishing on
the instalment plan. He thought how he had lived now at the
rate of $2,500 a year on a salary of $1,500; he thought of his
cigars, of his good clothes, of his children going to a good school;
he thought of his $700 piano on the instalment plan, of his wife’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
afternoon teas, of his two servants, of his rent $360 a year, of
his debts, how they grew; and the more he thought the more he
concluded that these things were all wrong, because he could
not afford them. He thought of his salary—$4.10 per day—and
wondered how he had ever expected to manage to keep four
children, himself and wife and two servants on it. Then he
thought of his notes floating about and how he had to juggle them
every month and rob Peter to pay Paul. And it looked wrong.</p>

<p>Of course he was only an idiot to let these things worry him.
But he explained all his thoughts to his wife, and the poor
woman began to think and have ideas, too. It was a cruel blow
to her,—she had never had an idea in her life, but had lived at
peace, and now peace was gone. She agreed with her idiot husband
that it was all wrong, and like a good, brave, dutiful and
thoughtful woman agreed to help him to right it all as far as
possible or further.</p>

<p>So these two poor idiots began to right things. They cancelled
the lease of their house, took the children from the private
school and sent them to a 50-cent-a-month school, the idiot
stopped smoking cigars and took to a clay pipe and <i>tabac catholique</i>,
they moved into six rooms at $12 per month, sold most
of their furniture, gave up the instalment piano, never kept a
drop of anything in the house, and never received any friends.</p>

<p>Rumour then said the idiot had got squeezed in stocks, and
the rumour got to his employer’s ears. The fact of the terrible
reduction in the expenses of the idiot seemed to substantiate the
rumour, and so he was discharged.</p>

<p>Debts that would have waited indefinitely during the idiot’s
apparent prosperity now began to press him, suits in law piled
up costs against him, and he walked the streets without employment,
and thought on and on and on. His friends said he had
lost his position because he had used money that did not belong
to him; his enemies said he was a thief.</p>

<p>His wife became prematurely old, slovenly and hopeless; the
children ragged and tough; the idiot himself struck odd jobs now
and again, but being unable any longer to hold up his head over
a clean collar and shirt, on account of his thoughts, he never
recovered his lost faith in himself. He drove a grocery wagon for
two years at $9.50 per week and then died,—his wife said of a
broken heart. The wife soon followed the idiot, and now his
children are stablemen, cooks, waitresses and things like that.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_TALE_OF_RUSSIA">A TALE OF RUSSIA</h2>
</div>


<p>Sloberino Pullovitch sat in his sumptuous office. He sat, because
he had been out the night before and did not know yet
how it had ended. Every time he moved, four secretaries jumped
to listen to his commands. Every time he snored, the four secretaries
rang bells, and seven messengers burst into the room, lined
up and bowed, awaiting orders. Outside of these doings, all was
quiet for several hours. Then Pullovitch spoke. He said, “Hoot
mon.” It will be noticed that Pullovitch spoke with a Scotch
accent; but he was not Scotch. He was a pure Russian; but his
mother had been frightened by a Scotch Terrier before he was
born—so Pullovitch was born with a Scotch plaid pattern on the
soles of his feet, and spoke Scotch when he was half-cocked. It
ought to be explained that Sloberino Pullovitch enjoyed a very
lucrative position in the Russian government, and was big Indian,
high up in political circles.</p>

<p>Pullovitch finally recovered consciousness about four p.m.,
and immediately there were doings. There were always doings
when he recovered from a jag. “Send for Spitoonski,” he roared,
and immediately the four secretaries and seven messengers got
out of harm’s way.</p>

<p>Spitoonski was the chief cook and bottle washer of Pullovitch.
He did for Pullovitch what Pullovitch did not care to do for himself.
He told the Pullovitch lies and did the squirming about,
and what is known in Russian Political Circles as “the dirty.”</p>

<p>It can be easily imagined that Spitoonski was not liked, but
feared; and that every poor government clerk trembled when he
came within the visual orbit of his little black pig-like eyes. He
was of low origin, and had sunk lower. He would do anything
for money but work, and was the willing tool of Pullovitch. He
never smiled. He believed it was not dignified to smile. He made
every effort he could to appear dignified, which was difficult, considering
he was only the height of six pennyworth of copper, had
a crooked neck and one shoulder higher than the other. Occasionally
Spitoonski would allow his face to wrinkle up in a beautiful
snarl. When he did this, he thought he was smiling, and checked
it immediately, which was a very welcome relief to the on-looker;
for it was very unsightly.</p>

<p>Immediately upon being notified, Spitoonski crawled into the
presence of his Chief, smiling. “Cover up your teeth and listen
to me, viper,” said Pullovitch.</p>

<p>Spitoonski bowed, and accepted the compliment.</p>

<p>“Among the rubbish we have employed under us,” continued
Pullovitch, “we have one Slopft, who never does anything but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
chatter to himself, eat, and sleep. He will soon be fit for a padded
room; but before he gets any more crazy, do thou prepare a
solemn ukase and have him made Chief Investigator of Pot Holes
at steen pieces of silver per month. His brother keeps a swell
gambling house, and has much influence; so we must do something.”</p>

<p>Spitoonski listened patiently, and then ventured to protest:
“Your highness,” said he, “if you will allow me to humbly make
a remark, I would say that if this thing is done your noble person
will be besieged by every Tom, Dick and Harry in your beautiful
and well ordered department. They will make you feel like a
singed horse in Fly Time. You know them.”</p>

<p>“Shut up and do my bidding. I did not ask for advice. Get
out, skiddaddle, vamose, scoot, mizzle, fly, or I’ll straighten your
crooked neck,” said Pullovitch, frothing at the mouth. And
Spitoonski thanked him kindly, and withdrew.</p>

<p>The morning following the <i>Daily Dung Heap</i> made the whole
community wise to the fact that the eminent citizen, Mr. P. Q.
R. S. Slopft, had been made Chief Investigator of Pot Holes.</p>

<p>Immediately there were doings in the Pullovitch Department.
Every one employed therein, from the Deputy down to
the Window Cleaner, prepared to pull such wires as they commanded
to the end of having immediate increase or promotion,
or both; and for seven days and seven nights the excitement was
intense. Letters, telegrams and petitions rained like hail upon
Pullovitch; but as Pullovitch had his personality submerged in
strong drink, the strain was only on the paper basket. Among the
importunates was one De Bum, a cunning rascal who had aided
and abetted a certain Buttinsky in an election, and he spake
with the said Buttinsky, saying:</p>

<p>“Go thou, Buttinsky, and fill Pullovitch up to the neck,
and when he is right have me installed as a First Class Clerk.
And do it quick, see?”</p>

<p>And Buttinsky was afraid lest De Bum should open his
mouth; so he loaded Pullovitch as he was bid, and De Bum became
in name and Salary, a First Class Clerk.</p>

<p>Now, these things being done, other happenings followed
as a matter of natural consequence. The respectable ones in
the Department of Pullovitch, who were not many by this time,
murmured among themselves, and said: “If we remain in the
service of Pullovitch we will lose our good name, and be classed
with such as Slopft and De Bum. Let us, therefore, resign
before it is too late.”</p>

<p>So every one who had any respect for himself resigned, and
left the Department of Pullovitch, and it became absolutely
corrupt.</p>

<p>Then other Departments became as that of Pullovitch, till
corruption crept even to the Throne. And the enemies of Russia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
who saw these things, waited and waited till she was rotten at
the heart. Then they rose up and slew her.</p>

<p>Corruption creeps in softly and easily; but is only eradicated
through much bloodshed and strife.</p>

<p>There was a certain Heathen who knew not how benighted
he was.</p>

<p>He knew naught of Honesty, of Virtue, of Charity, nor knew
he of Modern Civilization and the benefits thereof.</p>

<p>And the Heathen was contented in his ignorance. He was
satisfied with Enough and of the Standard Oil Company and its
methods he wot not—at least, if he wotted, it is not so reported
of him.</p>

<p>Now unto this Heathen came a Modern Missionary, girt with
Sword, with Commercialism and Militarism in his coat pockets,
with a Colt’s revolver on his hip, and a bottle of Champagny
Water in his grip, and he lifted up his voice and spake unto the
Heathen, saying:</p>

<p>“Harken, Behold, likewise lo, poor benighted Heathen. You
are a Good Thing, and you know it not; but I even I, the forerunner
and jumper of Peace and Goodwill, know it. I come to do
you good. You need a whole lot of saving and as the Prophet
of Civilization, I come to do the job. I bring you Peace, Virtue,
and Honesty, and a lot of other things that are handy to have
in the house. Your Gods I will take away from you. They will
make nice bric-a-brac.” And immediately, that is to say, as soon
as the Heathen wasn’t looking, he smote him a great smote with
the sword, so that he died at Peace, took his wife to do chores
about the house and annexed his property.</p>

<p>Wan thing oim after noticin’ lately is a great tindency on
the part of some folks who pertend to what they call culchure, to
throw into their conversation the worrd “gotten”—an ungainly
worrd that has been out of date since the time when yer grandfather
swore “odsbodkins” an’ the like, until some fad hunter
dug it up. Oi mind a friend of mine sint a note to his wife sayin’
“I have gotten tickets fer Melba to-night.” He wasn’t a very
good writer, an’ his wife thought he meant he had got <i>ten</i> tickets,
and begob she invited the whole neighborhood and it nearly broke
him makin’ good.</p>

<p>Now culchure is a quare thing; an uncommon thing; a thing
that’s hard to define and harder to get. ’Tis not in usin’ this
worrd “gotten” or any other perticular worrd; ’tis not in usin’ the
long “a” in “bath” or pronouncin’ “calf” as if it was “koff”;
nor is it in callin’ a counter jumper or a lad in the Civil Service
a “clark” instid of a “clerk.” Not a whit. All these things may
be signs of culchure, an’ they may not—mostly not. They are a
lot of people who niver had nawthin’ but a rude eddication, (that’s
whoy it’s called a “rudimentary eddication”), an’ never larned
anything since they wint to school; but who, be hook or be crook,
(mostly crook), an’ a few dollars, or inflooence, or by marryin’
into dollars and inflooence, have gotten onto the skirts of what
they call sassiety; an’ begob these people I’m tellin’ ye about
they think that culchure is in the usin’ of perticular worrds or in
perticular pernounce-i-ation. It niver enters their nuts that culchure
is shown by the thots ye express an’ the depth of knowledge
ye show of men an’ things, an’ not by little peculiarities of pro-nounce-i-ation
which a man may inherit from his grandfather, or
have caughten from a locality in his youth—de ye follow me?</p>

<p>Now “etiket” is the usages of culchured sassiety, an’ it’s fer
that same etiket that I’ve been stearin’ all the while. Etiket an’
culchure is not the same thing among different people. ’Tis wan
thing in wan place, an’ another in another place. Fer example, a
gintleman in the Figi Islands wud think it no disgrace to ate his
grandmother. ’Tis looked at different here, altho’ ye can skin
yer brother-in-law, or never return borried money to yer father-in-law.</p>

<p>Now, I gev ye all this harrd earned wisdom that I cud worrk
down to me frind Dundonald an’ his riferince to “Etiket.”—De
ye ketch me pint? Me Earl lad is no judge of Etiket in Canada;
he’s only a soldier anny way, an’ a soldier is no more a judge of
etiket than a butcher is of plumbin’, or an Englishman is of a
Canadian. Etiket, is it? Why, begob, I cud intrajuice the Dundonald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
into sassiety in Ottawa where he wud fall seven times over
etiket before he opened his mouth wanst.</p>

<p>Etiket changes wid locality, as I told ye. The Earl only
knowin’ wan kind, put his fut in it an’ showed his ignorance.
Sure the most of us is por, wan-sided creatures. We look a fact
in the face, an’ think we know all about it, never dreamin’ that it
shud be turned over an’ examined on the back of it, not to mintchin’
the several sides of it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BUSYBODIES">BUSYBODIES</h2>
</div>


<p>Busybodies are mostly of the female persuasion, wid an’
occasional parson of the milk and water type thrown in. They’re
to be found ivery place, except at home mindin’ their own business.
They’re always doin’ something that don’t need to be done,
an’ lavin’ alone their own affairs, which generally need attendin’
to. They’re the folks referred to in the prayer book as “poor miserable
sinners.” They’re always goin’ off half-cocked about somethin’
they don’t know anything about. I’ll warrant ye there’s not
wan of them who are tryin’ to pass the law to electrocute ye if ye
smoke cigarettes what ever had a whiff of a cigarette. Poor blind
creatures; they can’t see. I don’t use cigareets meself as a steady
diet, but I’ll wager there’s them that takes as much pleasure out
of a cigareet as Oi do frum me pipe, widout a divil a bit more
harum.</p>

<p>The cigareet gets credit fur doin’ harum it never done at all,
at all. Fer example, some good old busybody has a son that
she’s kept tied to her apron strings till he’s nearly a man. She
sinds him to college. There the lad, who is not bad, but only a
fool, cuts loose entirely, hits it up iviry night, drowns thots of his
unhappy home in booze, gets to know all the giddy girls in town,
is up all night playin’ tin cent limit, thinkin’ he’s a real spoort.
An’ along wid these things he smokes cigareets. When he comes
home they have to call in the doctor, an’ the old busybody tells
the doctor that the lad is killin’ himself wid cigareets. Nivir a
word about the booze, an’ the wimin, an’ the late hours; oh, no.
She knows nuthin’ of all this. Then she puts on her bonnet an’
goes to see all her cronies, an’ a bunch of thim comes along to
Ottawa to legislate agin the cigareet.</p>

<p>I tell ye legislation kin niver protect the fool from his foolishness.
If ye are a fool, begob, ye must suffer fer it.</p>

<p>I saw two good fer nuthin’ Italians on the street to-day
makin’ a livin’ out of peradin’ about a couple of mangy bears,
beatin’ the poor dumb creatures wid a pole to make thim turn summersalts
agin all nature. There’s somethin’ fer the busybodies
to think on fer a while. Make a law kapin’ out from this country
all such varmints that’s good fer nuthin’ to no wan. Am Oi right,
Oi’m askin’ ye?</p>

<p>If ye left the busybodies alone, begorrah, we’d have niver a
drink, niver a smoke, nor niver a dance wid the gurls. ’Tis horrible
to contemplate. They’d pass a law agin’ everything. Sure,
if they can pass this law agin the cigareet they’ll fally it up wid a
law measurin’ yer food to prevint ye atin’ too much, a law to boost
ye out of bed in time fer church, a law to prevint yer wife frum
lacin’ too tight; an’ I can tell ye if they do this last, all me pull
goes to get me the job of “Inspector of the Tension of Corsets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>Give the meddlers half a chantz an’ be hivins the government
will have to hire half of us to inspect the other half. ’Twill be
like this:—Wan of the kids will wake up in the middle of yer
beauty sleep yellin’, “Hurry up pa, and get up; there’s foive inspectors
in the kitchen waitin’ fer ye to sign their papers. One’s
vaccinatin’ the cook, one’s examinin’ brother Moike on the Shorter
Catechism, one’s fumigatin’ the cat, an’ the other two is waitin’
to search the house fer cigareet papers.”</p>

<p>A law is a funny thing. It is not only in the way it is expected
to act; but also in the ways that no wan cud foresee.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_FOOL_MARKET">THE FOOL MARKET</h2>
</div>


<p>The supply still keeps up with the enormous and ever increasing
demand for Fools, which is fortunate for the capitalist,
the plutocrat, the politician, and the church who are the largest
consumers in this line. The common article in the raw and entirely
unsophisticated is not so largely in demand as formerly;
but is still used in some localities more or less. An ever increasing
demand exists for the gilded article, and competition for choice
specimens in this line is always keen. A large assorted lot is maintained
for special purposes in Ottawa, and, while not available on
the open fool market, is held by a syndicate of politicians to be
used when exigent. Accordingly this large lot is sometimes high
priced, and sometimes away down below the market. Lately,
owing to local conditions, market values have been much depressed.
One of the strong ones of the syndicate has been heard
to define them as a “bad lot.” If by one means or another control
could be obtained of this large assorted Ottawa lot it could
be made very hot in the immediate vicinity; but such a happening
is very unlikely, as the syndicate at present in possession
is very strong and has lately taken measures to make such a scheme
nearly hopeless. If this motley lot should suddenly be stampeded,
open their eyes, become sophisticated and come to appreciate the
fact that they are alive, there would be a panic and fortunes
would be lost and won. There is a nervous and skittish feeling
among them at this time; so a stampede is not altogether an
unlikely event. Strong syndicates sometimes overshoot the mark.
We would therefore advise fool-holders to skin the eye and, as
some one has said, “Look out for the locomotive when the bell
rings.” Really no one knows what fools will do.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_STORY_OF_A_FULL_GROWN_MAN">THE STORY OF A FULL GROWN MAN</h2>
</div>


<p>A full grown man once had a position in the Civil Service.
He did the work of an average office boy in the business world, but
drew the salary of a man. The full grown man was not ashamed
of this. In fact, on the Q.T. he was of the opinion that he was
a very clever fellow, and that the work he did was very important.
The full grown man’s wife was a very different kind of person.
She was of the opinion that hubby was a pure mutton, and that
he was lucky to be in the Service; but she kept her opinion dark,
and among her friends, whom she referred to as “Society,” she
groaned over the fact that hubby was “so unlucky”; that it was
a shame the way he was paid; that he was so clever, don’t you
know,—and other things, which she thought people believed.</p>

<p>One evening when the full grown man and wife were out at
an affair, wifie began performing her conversational ledger-de-main
on a stranger who appeared to listen to her with great
patience. The stranger was a man who had been twenty years
in business, and had lately accepted a Civil Service position—with
thanks.</p>

<p>The stranger knew the full grown man. He made him tired.
So when wifie said that the Civil Service was only a bread and
butter mill, he said in reply: “Madam, it seems to me very unlikely
that a man who can make jam for his bread outside the
service would content himself with bread and butter for twenty
years.”</p>

<p>And wifie fell dead, and the next month the full grown man
was superannuated on “nothing” per year, and a school girl put
in his place.</p>
